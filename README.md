## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have been a long time away from coding and as a restart I'm using this project to warm things up. Throught this project I've been able to relearn flex and grid properties, though I've barely used grid just to center things up.

### Continued development

I want to learn a lot more about developing accessible websites and increase my skills on responsive designs. 

I feel that I need a better understanding on how sizes and some flex and grid properties works and I also need to improve my naming and semantic html notion, which I'll work hard this year.
